										<p>Hi, I am a rising Junior at Cornell University with the intended major in Statistical Sciences with a concentration in computer science and machine learning. I want to pursue a career in data science because of its versatility and application. I am eager to learn new techniques to analyze data that I can apply.
										</p>
										<p><strong>Progrmming Languages: </strong>Python (familiar with pandas, matplotlib, numpy, sklearn, sympy, streamlit, plotly, pyautogui, and pytesseract packages), Java, R, Javascript, HTML, CSS, SQL

											<h3>Personal Expenses Dashboard (Python)</h3>
											<p>Using streamlit and plotly, I created a dashboard to analyze my personal expenses. It allows you to subset the data by category and date. It also allows you to set labels on specific dates to help determine why personal expenses went up or down. For fun, I even included clustering to help categorize expenses.</p>

											<h3>Planet Pinky Lamb (Javascript Minigames)</h3>
											<p>Over the 2019 summer, I taught myself Javascript, HTML, and CSS using online resources such as Khan Academy, freeCodeCamp and W3Schools. I enjoy programming minigames that can incorporate my personal artwork. I built my own website that is hosted by Github so that others could access them more easily.</p>

											<h3>Democratic vs. Republican Covid Policies (Python)</h3>
											<p>For a class in school, I and two other students analyzed how the differing COVID-19 policy prescriptions affected public health and economic conditions. </p>
