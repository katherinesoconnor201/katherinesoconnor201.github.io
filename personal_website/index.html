                        <p>Hi, I am a Master's student in Applied Statistics at Cornell University and will graduate in May of 2024. Before this I completed by bachelor's degree in Statistical Sciences with a concentration in computer science and machine
                            learning at Cornell from 2020-2023. I want to pursue a career in data science because of its versatility and application . I am eager to learn new techniques to analyze data that I can apply.

                            <h3>Analysis of Nutrition and Food Security in Rural Malawi (Python)</h3>
                            <p>With a team of 5 other Master's studentds, I analyzed features most important for predicting food insecurity primarily using Gini Impurity of Random Forests and p-values of logistic regression models during this semester-long
                                project. Additionally, I wrote an interactive analytical dashboard that allowed users to instantaneously compare hundreds of features to one another.

                            <p>For a class in school, I and two other students analyzed how the differing COVID-19 policy prescriptions affected public health and economic conditions. </p>

                            <h3>Planet Pinky Lamb (Javascript Minigames)</h3>
                            <p>Over the 2019 summer, I taught myself Javascript, HTML, and CSS using online resources such as Khan Academy, freeCodeCamp and W3Schools. I enjoy programming minigames that can incorporate my personal artwork. I built my own
                                website that is hosted by Github so that others could access them more easily.</p>

                            <p>Using streamlit and plotly, I created a dashboard to analyze my personal expenses. It allows you to subset the data by category and date. It also allows you to set labels on specific dates to help determine why personal expenses
                                went up or down. For fun, I even included clustering to help categorize expenses.</p>

                            <h3>Catan Optimization (Python)</h3>
                            <p>This is a work in progress, "for fun" project. The goal is to write an algorithm to determine the best starting position and locations to settle in Catan based on finding the most interconeected node. In the future, I want
                                to play with the reawrd functions to allow the user to weight how much they want roads vs settlements vs cities to contriute to the reward function.</p>

                        <li three>Medtech For Solutions is a company that manages IVF labs across the United States. I had the incredible opportunity to analyze pre-implantation genetic testing embryology data of 20,000 embryos that were created within that last
                            three years.
                        </li>
                        <li> I mainly wrote Python functions to standardize and conduct statistical analysis on preimplantation genetic testing data to improve clinical outcomes and for quality control. I also used PyAutoGUI and Pytesseract to automate quarterly
                            reports and data entry from EMR data.</li>
